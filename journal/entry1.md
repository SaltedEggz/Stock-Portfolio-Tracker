# Learning Journey - Entry 1
**Date:** 2025-10-19

## What I Worked On
- Started my first C++ project: Stock Portfolio Tracker
- Learned how to read from files using `ifstream`
- Learned to use `while(file >> ...)` loops
- Practiced debugging why my total was $0
- Learned how to push projects to GitHub

## Challenges
- File not being found by the program
- Understanding how the extraction operator (`>>`) works
- Getting the GitHub push to work correctly

## Key Takeaways
- Always check file paths and naming
- The type of variable tells C++ how to read data
- GitHub updates happen with `git add → git commit → git push`

## Next Steps
- Add more data per stock (shares, favorites)
- Allow dynamic user input
- Continue documenting learning process in future entries

## Notes
- git add . → stages all files (new or modified) 
- git commit -m "message" → saves a snapshot of your changes 
- git push -u origin main → uploads your changes to GitHub
